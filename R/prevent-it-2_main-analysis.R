# Data analysis ----------------------------------------------------------------

# This script is written with the assumption that the data have already been
# wrangled into suitable structures.

## Preliminary note ------------------------------------------------------------

# For all analyses using mixed-effects models, we will not impute missing data.

## Primary research question ---------------------------------------------------

# Is there a decrease in problematic sexual urges as a function of the treatment?

# Note: This analysis corresponds to the primary outcome measure in the
# ClinicalTrials preregistration.

# The primary outcome is a measure of problematic sexual urges, assessed through
# the SSAS. We will use the sum score from the 12 items on the SSAS, for a total
# score that varies from 0 to 48 (each item uses a 0 to 4 scale). For the
# present study, we will modify items 3, 6, and 8 on the SSAS. These three items
# prompt the participant to provide an estimate of how much time they have been
# spent in the last week engaged in problematic sexual thoughts or behaviors. In
# the original measure, participants are asked to indicate an estimate given
# pre-specified intervals. Here, we will prompt them to provide an estimate with
# a drop down menu. We will then convert these values into a 0-4 scale. For each
# item, an estimate of 0 hours will be coded as 0. Using the non-zero values
# (across all measurement points), we will calculate quartiles, and these
# quartiles will form the basis of the scores of 1 through 4 (1 = >0% and <25%,
# 2 = >=25% and <50%, 3 = >=50% and <75%, 4 = >=75%). Any responses using the
# option "more than 24 hours" will not be used to calculate the quartiles and
# will be coded as 4.

# For this composite outcome variable we will fit a linear mixed effects
# model, with a dummy coded treatment predictor (0 = waitlist, 1 = Prevent It),
# indicating whether treatment has commenced, a time predictor (starting at 0,
# and counting each weekly measurement point), and a time-since-treatment
# predictor (starting at 0, and counting up at each measurement point after
# treatment begins). We will also fit another model adding quadratic terms for
# the time and time-since-treatment predictors. We will compare these two models
# using a likelihood ratio test and retain the better performing model for
# interpretation. We will use a significance threshold of .05 for all tests.

# For significance tests for the coefficients in the linear mixed effects
# models, we will use the Satterthwaite method for calculating degrees of
# freedom.

# Some participants will be assigned to receive treatment immediately, and
# others will be assigned to a waitlist during that treatment period (and will
# receive treatment thereafter).
#
# Treatment begins with a baseline measurement, followed by nine weeks of
# treatment, with a measurement taken at each week. The waitlist is measured on
# the same schedule as those who begin treatment immediately, and then a
# baseline measure is taken in four weeks.
#
# This schedule can be represented schematically as follows:
#
# TREATMENT: 
# time:       00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# treatment:  00 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# time_after: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
#
# WAITLIST:  
# time        00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 -- -- -- 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
# treatment:  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 -- -- -- 00 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01
# time_after: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 -- -- -- 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 
#
# Each double-digit number represents a measurement point, noted with its 
# corresponding value for each predictor variable.
#
# This schematic diagram does not include the "follow-up" measurement for the
# Treatment group and the waitlist group (after treatment). This follow-up 
# measure point will not be included in the primary analysis.

# Sensitivity analyses/Robustness checks

## Selection model

# We will use a Heckman-type selection modeling approach as a sensitivity
# analysis. First we will predict missingness in the SSAS data using a probit
# model. We will then use the predicted values from the probit model to
# calculate the inverse Mills ratio, which will then be added as a predictor in
# the model predicting the outcome. The probit model will use the same
# predictors as the outcome model, with additional predictors expected to be
# associated with missingness.

### Missingness model (probit)

# This model will be modified to incorporate predictors that are deemed
# plausible to predict dropouts/missingness, based on clinical experience and
# exploration of the data. For now, "ADDITIONAL_PREDICTORS" is included in the
# model formula as a placeholder.

# Time points 10, 11, and 12 will be missing by design, so they will treated as
# missing in the variable indicating (unplanned) missingness.

## Secondary research questions ------------------------------------------------

### Is there a change in abuse behavior?

# Note: This analysis corresponds to the secondary outcome measure in the
# ClinicalTrials preregistration.

# This secondary research question concerns the effect of the Prevent It 2.0
# treatment, compared to a waitlist control group, on the time spend using CSAM
# to socializing with children, having sexual interactions with children, and
# other behaviors related to sexual interest in children.
#
# These behaviors will be assessed using Part B of the SChiMRA+ (4 items)

# Each of the four items on Part B of the SChiMRA+ takes a measure of the number
# of days in which the participant engaged in the behavior of interest, time
# spent in hours engaging in the behavior for each active day of the last seven
# days, as well as a measure of either the age of the youngest child involved in
# the activities of each day and/or the severity of the material (using the
# COPINE scale). For each seven day period, each participant's time measures
# will be summed (in hours) and divided by 7, to create a daily average measure
# for that week. For the youngest age and COPINE severity measure, we will take
# the lowest reported age for that week and the highest reported COPINE severity
# for that week, and these will serve as dependent measures.

# We will address this research question with models highly similar to those
# used for the primary research question.
